Problem statement
Given two unsorted arrays of non-negative integers, 'arr1' and 'arr2' of size 'N' and 'M', respectively. Your task is to find the pair of elements (one from each array), such that their absolute (non-negative) difference is the smallest, and return the min difference.

Example :
N = 3, arr1 = [10, 20, 30]
M = 2, arr2 = [17, 15]
The smallest difference pair is (20, 17) with an absolute difference of 3. So, the answer is 3.
Note :
Both the arrays are unsorted, and all array elements are non-negative integers.

Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
Test Case 1 :
The smallest difference pairs are (7, 6) and (5, 6) with an absolute difference of 1, so the answer is 1.

Test Case 2 :
The smallest difference pair is (20, 17) with an absolute difference of 3, so the answer is 3.
