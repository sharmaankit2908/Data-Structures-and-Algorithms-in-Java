Problem statement
You are given the Trie class with following functions -

1. insertWord

2. removeWord

Now, you need to create one more function (named "countWords" ) which returns the number of words currently present in Trie in O(1) time complexity.

Note : You can change the already given functions in the Trie class, if required..
