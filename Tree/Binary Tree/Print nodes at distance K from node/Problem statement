Problem statement
You are given a Binary Tree of type integer, a integer value of target node's data, and an integer value K.

Print the data of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node. The order in which they would be printed will not matter.

Example:

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Input Format:
The first line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.

The second line of input contains two integers separated by a single space, representing the value of the target node and K, respectively.
Output Format:
All the node data at distance K from the target node will be printed on a new line.

The order in which the data is printed doesn't matter.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.
1 ≤ data of node ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ target ≤ 10^9
