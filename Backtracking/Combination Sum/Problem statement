Problem statement
You are given an array 'ARR' of 'N' distinct positive integers. You are also given a non-negative integer 'B'.



Your task is to return all unique combinations in the array whose sum equals 'B'. A number can be chosen any number of times from the array 'ARR'.



Elements in each combination must be in non-decreasing order.



For example:
Let the array 'ARR' be [1, 2, 3] and 'B' = 5. Then all possible valid combinations are-

(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 1, 2)
(1, 1, 3)
(1, 2, 2)
(2, 3)

Input Format
Then the first line contains two space-separated integers, 'N' and 'B', denoting the number of elements in the array and the target sum, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains 'N' space-separated integers representing the elements of the array 'ARR'.
Output Format :
The only line will contain 'Yes', if the answer is correct. Else, it will contain 'No'.
Note:

You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Sample Input 1 :
3 8
