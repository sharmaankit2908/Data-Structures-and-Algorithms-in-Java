Problem statement
A thief is robbing a store and can carry a maximal weight of W into his knapsack. There are N items and the ith item weighs wi and is of value vi. Considering the constraints of the maximum weight that a knapsack can carry, you have to find and return the maximum value that a thief can generate by stealing items.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer T representing the number of test cases.      
The T-test cases are as follows:

Line 1:The first line contains an integer, that denotes the value of N. 
Line 2:The following line contains N space-separated integers, that denote the values of the weight of items. 
Line 3:The following line contains N space-separated integers, that denote the values associated with the items. 
Line 4:The following line contains an integer that denotes the value of W. W denotes the maximum weight that a thief can carry.
Output Format :
The first and only line of output contains the maximum value that a thief can generate, as described in the task. 
The output of every test case is printed in a separate line.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^2
1<= wi <= 50
1 <= vi <= 10^2
1 <= W <= 10^3
