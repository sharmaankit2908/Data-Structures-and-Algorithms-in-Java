Problem statement
Given an integer array A of size n. Find and print all the leaders present in the input array. An array element A[i] is called Leader, if all the elements following it (i.e. present at its right) are less than or equal to A[i].

Print all the leader elements separated by space and in the reverse order. That means whichever leader comes at last should be printed first.
