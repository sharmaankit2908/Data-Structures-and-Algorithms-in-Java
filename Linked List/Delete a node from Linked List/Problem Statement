Problem statement
You have been given a linked list of integers. Your task is to write a function that deletes a node from a given position, 'POS'.

Note :
Assume that the Indexing for the linked list always starts from 0.

If the position is greater than or equal to the length of the linked list, you should return the same linked list without any change.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Input format :
The first line contains the elements of the linked list separated by a single space. 
The second line contains the integer value of 'POS'. It denotes the position in the linked list from where the node has to be deleted.
 Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element
Output format :
Print the resulting linked list of integers in a row, separated by a single space.
Note:

You are not required to print the output, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function. 
Sample Input 1 :
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1
3
Sample Output 1 :
3 4 5 6 1 9
Explanation of Sample Output 1 :
The data in the node with index 3 is 2 which has been removed.
Sample Input 2 :
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1
0
Sample Output 2 :
4 5 2 6 1 9
Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^5
POS >= 0

Time Limit: 1sec
Expected Complexity :
Time Complexity  : O(N)
Space Complexity  : O(1)
